# Getting and creating projects

- ### create an empty Git repository
  the hidden .git directory is the brain/storage center for the repository. It holds all of the configuration files and directories and is where all of the commits are stored.

  `git init`

- ### create an identical copy of an existing repository

  `git clone <url>`

- ### clone a repo and give it a new name

  `git clone <url> newname`
